DEPRECATED: RandomForest volatility training module removed.

This file previously contained training helpers for a RandomForest baseline.
Per project changes, the RandomForest training and prediction endpoints
have been removed and replaced with a diagnostics-focused workflow.

If you need to keep an archived copy of the prior implementation, recover it
from version control history. Importing this module will raise ImportError to
avoid accidental usage.
